        Midspace is hybrid-ready for the current most common formats of hybrid
        events, including presentations by physical and virtual speakers,
        participation in Q&amp;A by virtual and physical audiences, recording,
        mirrored sessions, and more.

        Hybrid socialising remains an unsolved challenge which we are actively
        researching, alongside other aspects of hybrid conferencing. We welcome
        the opportunity to work with conferences interested in exploring new
        ideas and discovering new modes of interaction.
