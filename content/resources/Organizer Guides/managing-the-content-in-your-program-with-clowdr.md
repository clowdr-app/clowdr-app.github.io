We know content is at the center of your community - and consequently, content management tends to be one of the most laborious parts of running a conference. 

Clowdr makes it easy to manage content, and empowers organizers to delegate and automate parts of the content management process to reallocate time to other critical parts of the event - such as building community and connections. 

The following resource summarizes how organizers can easily manage complex program content with Clowdr.

We share a brief overview of how content is managed in Clowdr, then walk through Clowdrâ€™s UI to show you exactly how to add a content item in Clowdr. Common scenarios are identified and advice for how to tackle them is provided!

_To learn about linking content to the schedule, see our_ [_managing your schedule with Clowdr_](https://clowdr.org/resources/schedule) _resource, and to learn about assigning people to manage content, view our_ [_managing people within Clowdr_](https://clowdr.org/resources/people) _resource._
