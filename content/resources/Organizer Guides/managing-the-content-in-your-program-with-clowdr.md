We know content is at the center of your community - and consequently, content management tends to be one of the most laborious parts of running a conference. 

Clowdr makes it easy to manage content, and empowers organizers to delegate and automate parts of the content management process to reallocate time to other critical parts of the event - such as building community and connections. 

The following resource summarizes how organizers can easily manage complex program content with Clowdr.

We share a brief overview of how content is managed in Clowdr, then walk through Clowdr’s UI to show you exactly how to add a content item in Clowdr. Common scenarios are identified and advice for how to tackle them is provided!

_To learn about linking content to the schedule, see our_ [_managing your schedule with Clowdr_](https://clowdr.org/resources/schedule) _resource, and to learn about assigning people to manage content, view our_ [_managing people within Clowdr_](https://clowdr.org/resources/people) _resource._

**You can follow these simple instructions to add individual content items to your program in Clowdr (batch imports are also possible):**

1. Navigate to the Content area of the Clowdr admin dashboard.

1. We can see a few Content items are already listed in the program. From this page, you can add a new Content item to your program using the Create New button.

1. The Create New dialog will open and present you with options to add a title to your content, determine content type (paper, poster, keynote, etc.), and optionally add tags that will help organize the content on the conference landing page. Tags can be managed from the main content page.

1. After you click Create, you’ll see the new Content item appear as a new row on the Content page, and a right sidebar will appear with options for customizing your content item.

1. Options to customize the content item include:
   * Adding a discussion room
   * Adding content elements (files, videos, links, and more) that can be directly added to the item as an organizer from within Clowdr
   * Adding uploadable content (elements that can be delegated externally to authors and other contributors), and 
   * Managing and adding people 
2. For this example we will focus on adding content and uploadable content.
