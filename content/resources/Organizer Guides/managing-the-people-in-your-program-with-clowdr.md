This resource summarizes how you can effectively manage the people associated with your event - including their connection to your event's content and schedule.

We share a brief overview of the relationship between people and the other major program components, then walk through Clowdr's UI to show you exactly how to link People to Content, Events, and Registrants on the platform.

Common scenarios are identified and advice for how to tackle them is provided!

**Here are a few easy steps to add a Session Chair to a piece of Content:**

1. Navigate to the Content area from the Admin Dashboard.

2. **Select the content item (paper, poster, workshop, etc.) you would like to assign a Chair to by checking the box next to the item.** A sidebar will open, revealing a People section at the top. By expanding this section, you will find a Manage Content People button - this will lead you to a new dialog.

3. **Now you find yourself in the Manage Content People area.** There are two options for how to select a person to assign the role of chair to within this piece of content. You are able to either:

    A. Select an individual from the available list to assign a role to (by clicking the checkbox next to the name) or

    B. Create a new individual (using the button at the top).

For the purpose of this exercise, we will elect to add a new person to this content item by using the Create New button.

5. **Once the Create New dialog appears, you can use the dropdown menu to identify the person in your program you want to associate to this piece of content.** In this case, we have selected Benjamin. From this same dialog, we can assign him the desired role of Chair, as well as select the Priority of the individual (this translates to the order Benjamin's name will be listed on the content item - this is particularly useful for Authors).

6. Once you've made your selections and hit the Create button, you'll be able to see the new person who you've added as chair in the list of people associated with this content item.
