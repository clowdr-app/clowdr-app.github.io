### Technical Requirements for Using Clowdr

We want to make sure that all attendees have a great experience on Clowdr! Here are the minimum technical requirements for using our platform:

* Highly recommended to have a stable connection at at least 5Mbps (same as YouTube recommends for 1080p)
* Newest version of Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari
* Windows 10 or latest macOS

**Tip:** We also highly recommend attendees use headphones and an external camera, when available. This ensures a more comfortable experience during those long networking hours!
