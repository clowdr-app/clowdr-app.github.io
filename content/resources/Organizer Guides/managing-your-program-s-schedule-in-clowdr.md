We share a brief overview of the relationship between events and content, then walk through Clowdrâ€™s UI to show you exactly how to create and schedule an event.

Common scenarios are identified and advice for how to tackle them is provided!

**You can also follow these simple instructions to create an event in your schedule:**

1. Navigate to the Schedule area of the Clowdr admin dashboard.

2. We can see a few events are already listed in the program. From this page, you can add a new event to your program using the green plus (+) sign on the left.

3. The Create New dialog will have appeared after clicking the green plus sign. Add the event start date and time, end date and time, event name, and associated room that it will be hosted in.

4. From here, you can also link any content that will be presented during the event and will show up as part of the event on the schedule. Select your preferred Mode (format) for the event from the dropdown list - this includes workshop, Q&A, presentation, pre-recorded video, and many others.  Lastly, you have the option to select for the event to be associated with an Exhibition, if this grouped content format is part of your program.
5. After you click Create, you'll see your new event appear as a new row in the Schedule's list of events!
6.  You'll notice this new event is highlighted with an alert icon on the left.  This is a notification that appears on events that require a live presenter at the event. This is determined by the Mode you have selected. In this case, we created a Q&A event, so the alert is telling us we need to assign presenters for this session.
