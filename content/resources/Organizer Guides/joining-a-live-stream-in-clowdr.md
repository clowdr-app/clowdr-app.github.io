This video briefly summarizes Clowdr's video pipeline capabilities, then explains what you need to do as a presenter or chair at an event. We walk through Clowdr's UI going from logging in, to finding the room for your event, to opening and joining the backstage area. Common problems are also identified and brief advice for how to tackle them is provided.

To join a live-stream in Clowdr, please follow these three stages, starting at the latest the day before your event.

## 1. Prepare in advance

1. [**Log in (or sign up)**](https://app.clowdr.org)

   You should have received an invite code from your conference organizers via an email from Clowdr. After signing up and confirming your email address, you can use the invite code to register for your conference.

   Please use a desktop or laptop device for the best experience (for both you and attendees watching your live-stream). iPads and mobile phones are not a good choice (unless professionally set up).
2. **Find or create a social room to check your camera/microphone permissions**

   * First, select the conference you are attending from your list of conferences.  
   * In the left sidebar you will find Clowdr's main navigation menus. Choose a social room (or create one using the "plus" button). 
   * Once you are on the room page, try to enable your camera and microphone
   * Finally, click the "Join room" button. 
   
   If you have trouble enabling your camera or microphone, such as "Permission denied" error messages, [please follow these instructions to resolve the problem](TODO "Instructions for fixing camera, microphone and screen sharing permissions").  
     
   If you plan to give a presentation using slides or an on-screen demo, you should also try enabling screen sharing. If you have problems with browser or operating system permissions, please follow the instructions linked above to resolve the problem.
3. **Invite a friend to join you. Check your camera/microphone quality**

   You'll need a friend to help you with this step! Either someone you already know at the conference, or a stranger in a social room, or your session chair. Anybody will do! Ask them to join the social room and let you know how you look and sound.

   > **We strongly recommend wearing headphones** and using an external USB microphone if you have one available. If you're using a headset, please remember to position the microphone correctly: below your chin - out of the line of your breath.
   >
   > Feedback loops caused by using speakers (even fabled Apple devices) are almost unavoidable and awful for attendees watching your live-stream. Most built-in microphones sound poor too.
4. **Find the room for your event  
   **When preparing in advance, you'll need to find which room your event is scheduled in. On the day of your event, you'll be able to find your room using the "Today's Program Rooms" section of the left sidebar. 

     
   To find your event, either browser the Schedule or search in the Happening Soon section for your own name or the title of your event. Click on your event to open the item page. At the bottom of the item page you will find a summary of the scheduled times and rooms for your item. Use the first of the two tables to find the relevant room.
5. **Session chairs: Watch or read the presentations in advance  
   **TODO: Can't watch stream backstage; must prepare questions in advance

## 2. Arrive ahead of time

Your speakers' (a.k.a. backstage) area will become available 20 minutes in advance of your event (in the same room as your event is scheduled in - the one we found in Step 4 of "Prepare in advance"). 

Your speakers' area will appear automatically in the same room as your event. From 1 hour before your event, you will see a countdown to let you the time left until your speakers' area becomes available.

**Your speakers' area will become available 20 minutes in advance of the scheduled _live presentation/Q&A_ period of your event - not including pre-recorded playback.** 

**Clowdr's data model does not include "sessions". Your speakers' area becomes available 20 minutes in advance of your event, not your session.**

## 3. Join the speakers' area

1. **If you see multiple speakers' areas, open the next one you at which you are presenting or chairing.   
   _(If only one area is available, it will open automatically.)  
     
   _**Click the "Open this area" button to open a particular speakers' area.

     
   If you are the presenter or chair at multiple events, you will see a separate speakers' area for each event. You should join the next one at which you are needed. 
2. **Enable your camera and microphone, just as you did during step 2 of "Prepare in advance".**
3. **Join the room  
   **To participate in the live-stream, the final step is to click "Join room".  
     
   Once in the room, you can toggle your camera, microphone or screen sharing. You will see anyone else who is due to present with you and can use the time available to chat to them.  
     
   If you are a session chair, you should chat to the presenters in the backstage, get to know them a little and help them to feel comfortable.
4. **(Optional) Start sharing your screen  
   **If you need to show slides or give a demo, you can enable screen sharing after joining the room.
5. **Watch for the countdown
