This video briefly summarizes Clowdr's video pipeline capabilities, then explains what you need to do as a presenter or chair at an event. We walk through Clowdr's UI going from logging in, to finding the room for your event, to opening and joining the backstage area. Common problems are also identified and brief advice for how to tackle them is provided.

To join a live-stream in Clowdr, please follow these three stages, starting at the latest the day before your event.

## 1. Prepare in advance

1. **[Log in (or sign up)](https://app.clowdr.org)**

   You should have received an invite code from your conference organizers via an email from Clowdr. After signing up and confirming your email address, you can use the invite code to register for your conference.
   
   Please use a desktop or laptop device for the best experience (for both you and attendees watching your live-stream). iPads and mobile phones are not a good choice (unless professionally set up).
   
2. **Find or create a social room to check your camera/microphone permissions**

   First, select the conference you are attending from your list of conferences.
   
   In the left sidebar you will find Clowdr's main navigation menus. Choose a social room (or create one using the "plus" button). Once in the room, try to enable your camera and microphone, then click Join Room. If you have trouble enabling your camera or microphone, such as "Permission denied" error messages, please follow these instructions to resolve the problem.
   
3. **Invite a friend to join you. Check your camera/microphone quality**

   You'll need a friend to help you with this step! Either someone you already know at the conference, or a stranger in a social room, or your session chair. Anybody will do! Ask them to join the social room and let you know how you look and sound.
   
   > **We strongly recommend wearing headphones** and using an external USB microphone if you have one available. If you're using a headset, please remember to position the microphone correctly: below your chin - out of the line of your breath.
   >
   > Feedback loops caused by using speakers (even fabled Apple devices) are almost unavoidable and awful for attendees watching your live-stream. Most built-in microphones sound poor too.

4. **Find the room for your event**
