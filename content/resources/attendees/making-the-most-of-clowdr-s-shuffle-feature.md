Shuffle queues provide an opportunity for attendees to network in a randomized way, for a set amount of time.

The following information provides an brief summary of the following:

* What is Shuffle?
* How to join a Shuffle queue
* Tips for how to use the Shuffle feature as an organizer

**Shuffle Queues**

* A Shuffle queue runs between set times (max 30 minutes)
* Attendees join the queue when it is running.
* When enough people are in the queue, they are automatically divided up and allocated to auto-generated Shuffle rooms to meet other attendees for rounds of networking! 
* The allocation/grouping algorithm aims to place the target number of people in a room together - but will do fewer if not enough are people are in the queue.
* If someone is in the Shuffle queue on their own for a while, they are allocated to an existing room if that room has less than the maximum number of people.
* The Shuffle rooms last for a set number of minutes each. When a room ends, people are taken back to the queue page and can rejoin to be allocated to a new room with new people!

**Organizer Tips**

* As an organizer, you can assign specific individuals to rooms (special guests or speakers, mentors, etc) to facilitate speaker roundtables or mentoring sessions!
* The target and maximum number of people per room is configurable to customize the experience for your event.
