# Code of Conduct & Reporting Violations

Midspace is committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment for all event participants and staff. 

All platform users, including, but not limited to attendees, speakers, exhibitors, staff members, and all others are expected to abide by our code of conduct.

This applies to all events on the Midspace platform. Please take a moment to review these important guidelines. 

Conferences taking place on our platform may have their own code of conduct guidelines and are responsible for monitoring and enforcing adherence during their events. 

### Code of Conduct for Online Behavior

In order to preserve a climate that encourages both civil and fruitful dialogue, we encourage anyone who witnesses or hears of unacceptable behavior to flag or report it to your event organizer immediately. 

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access for anyone who violates the following rules:

1. Adhere to a policy of zero-tolerance for any form of harassment, intimidation or discrimination.
2. Be respectful in the way you communicate with others. Be tolerant of otherâ€™s viewpoints. The discussions and comments are meant to stimulate conversation, not to create contention.
3. All defamatory, abusive, profane, threatening, offensive, or illegal materials are strictly prohibited.
4. Disruption of presentations during sessions will be considered unacceptable behavior and dealt with immediately. All participants must comply with the instructions of the moderator and/or any conference organizing team member or designated Midspace staff.
5. Midspace and the conference organizing team reserve the right to reject/delete any messaging, posting and/or presentation for any violation of the Code of Conduct.

**As a user of Midspace, you agree to adhere to the safety rules and guidelines put in place for events on Midspace.** 

### Reporting Violations

If you witness behavior that is in violation of our guidelines, you can take action by:

1. Flagging a message for review.

2. Raising the issue in the the event's Help Desk chat. 

2. Direct messaging an organizer, moderator, or session chair in a private chat.
