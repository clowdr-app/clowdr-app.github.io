Shuffle queues provide a fun opportunity for attendees to network in a randomized way, for a set amount of time.

![](/images/shuffle-10.jpg)The following section provides an brief summary covering:

- What is Shuffle?
- How to join a Shuffle queue
- Tips for how to use the Shuffle feature as an organizer

**Shuffle Queues**

- A Shuffle queue runs between set times (max 30 minutes)
- Attendees join the queue when it is running.
- When enough people are in the queue, they are automatically divided up and allocated to auto-generated Shuffle rooms to meet other attendees for rounds of networking!
- The allocation/grouping algorithm aims to place the target number of people in a room together - but will do fewer if not enough are people are in the queue.

- If someone is in the Shuffle queue on their own for a while, they are allocated to an existing room if that room has less than the maximum number of people.
- The Shuffle rooms last for a set number of minutes each. When a room ends, people are taken back to the queue page and can rejoin to be allocated to a new room with new people!

**Organizer Tips**

- As an organizer, you can assign specific individuals to rooms (special guests or speakers, mentors, etc) to facilitate speaker roundtables or mentoring sessions!

- The target and maximum number of people per room is configurable to customize the experience for your event.
