## What is Content?

Content is additional information associated with a presentation.

- Content can be an abstract, text, videos, images, slides, or a website link.
- You can add some limited types of content using the importer, but after importing your program you can add more content types using the Midspace manage menu.
	- See: [Importing your program](https://resources.midspace.app/organizer-guides/getting-started/import/#Overview)
-  You may optionally allow speakers to edit the abstracts of their presentations within Midspace.
- Content is typically uploaded to Midspace by speakers using Midspaceâ€™s purpose-built submissions system.

### Types 

The content type is a label which describes what type of content is being presented. The type does not affect how people interact with your content. It is simply a label to help your attendees better understand your schedule.

When you a new content element in Midspace, you'll need to select a type from the dropdown menu. **Note**: Content types are called "Label" in Create New content menu.
