There are two main categories of people in a conference: **program people** and **registrants**.

## Program People

Program people are the people who contribute to your conference. This can include conference organizers, authors of content being presented, presenters of an event, or program chairs. A person doesn't need to be an attendee of your conference (AKA, a "registrant") to be a program person. For example, an author of a paper who will not be present at your conference would be a program person, but not a registrant.

People can be linked to content, events, and registrants. Linking program people will affect how their names are displayed in a conference and what features of Midspace they have access to.

You can add program people to your conference by following [this guide](/organizer-guides/conference-setup/people/#You-can-also-follow-these-brief-instructions-to-add-a-person-to-your-program). Once a person has been added to your conference, you'll have the option to link them to any content, event, or registrant in Midspace.
