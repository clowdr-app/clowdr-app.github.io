## Importing your Program

### Sessions

A conference's program schedule is made up of [sessions](/organizer-guides/concepts/Events#Sessions). A session is an event on your conference's calendar that contains one or more [presentations](/organizer-guides/concepts/Events#Presentations). Please refer to [this article](/organizer-guides/concepts/Events/) to learn more about sessions and events in a conference.

See the session titled "Presentations on Sleep Science" in the example import table below.

After importing this table, the session will appear as a block on your conference's calendar.

### Presentations

You can add the presentations that are a part of each session to the import table. Each session is made up of one or more presentations.

You should add the following information to each presentation:
- **Title**: the name of your presentation
- **Type**: a label which describes what type on content is being presented
	- For more information on types, see [Content](/organizer-guides/concepts/Content)
- **Duration**: the length of the presentation in minutes
	- The durations of all presentations in a session must be equal to the total time length of that session
- **Abstract** (optional)

If you decide to change any of this information later, you can edit it after you import your program to Midspace.

The presentation type can be selected from the dropdown menu.

In your conference, information about each presentation within a session will show on the information page for that session. Navigate to the session's information page by clicking on that session in the schedule and clicking "Find out more".
